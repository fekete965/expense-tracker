## React Router v6 :
### Functionalities used are :
    - Loaders, ErrorElements, action
    - localStorage to store data
    - useRouterError() hook to display error
    - toastify to add a toast to the application on success of an action
    - Form component is used to write forms 
    - useFetcher() hook to manage state. Best suitable submitting data WITHOUT navigation. 
    
##Errors:
    - error object returns undefined for useRouterError
    -

## Challenges :
    - painstakingly difficult to establish the same design for elements throughout the application. In dire need of UI library
    - 

## Local Storage :
    - Save username, budget, expense
